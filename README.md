Users can view the uploaded files, and depending on their permissions, they can rename or delete them.

User Authentication:
The app integrates with backend authentication, ensuring that only logged-in users can upload, rename, or delete files.

Toast Notifications:
On successful file upload, deletion, or error, a toast notification will inform the user of the action.
