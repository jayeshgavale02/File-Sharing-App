1. **File Upload**:  
   Users can upload files by selecting them using a file input field. The app sends the file to the backend using **Axios** and shows a success or error notification.

2. **File Management**:  
   Users can view the uploaded files and, depending on their permissions, rename or delete files.

3. **User Authentication**:  
   The app ensures that only authenticated users can perform file operations.
